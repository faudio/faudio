// Scheduled events are forwarded to the audio thread in advance. This is the
// threshold value in milliseconds. A too low value may cause actions to be
// executed too late, if the scheduler is busy or for some other reason cannot
// forward the actions in time. A higher value minimizes that risk, but actions
// that have been forwarded to the audio thread cannot be cancelled, so a very
// high value will make e.g. stop playback appear sluggish. Also, action_do
// (and action_do_with_time) is executed in the audio control thread rather
// than the audio thread, which means that they will be executed (more) too early.

/** @addtogroup FaAction
 
    Scheduling actions.
    
    The action types represent a single interaction with a running stream, such
    as a note or a control change.
    
    Actions can be *scheduled* on both real-time and non-real-time 
    devices: in the first case they are carried out when the internal clock of
    the stream reaches the scheduled time, in the latter case they are simply
    carried out at the appropriate time.
    
    For scheduling actions, see @ref fa_audio_schedule, @ref fa_midi_schedule
    or @ref fa_signal_run.
